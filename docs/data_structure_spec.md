# Data Structure Specification  
### EEGLAB-style multimodal structure for EEG, ET, and IBI signals

This document defines the unified **Python data structure** for handling multimodal child-caregiver data recorded with:
- EEG (electroencephalography),
- ET (eye-tracking),
- IBI (inter-beat interval, derived from ECG).

The structure is designed for transparent integration across different signal types, maintaining synchronisation and consistent metadata.

The data are stored as a Python class, named `Data`.
